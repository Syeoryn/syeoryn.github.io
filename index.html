  <p>Looks like you've caught me with my site down...</p>
  <br/>
  <p>We'll be up soon!</p>
  <p>Maybe in the meantime I can interest you in a <a href="http://syeoryn.github.io/watchout">game</a>?</p>
  <p>Or perhaps you'd prefer a bit of <a href="http://drewcuth.azurewebsites.net">reading?</a></p>

  <p>As long as you're here, I may as well suggest you <a href="http://www.twitter.com/drewcuth1">follow 
    me on twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/syeoryn">check out my GitHub page</a>, and 
    <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/accuth">browse around my LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>
